## Decide to Give a Talk

Why? **Be part of the community**

## What do you want to say?

- Write down the ideas
- Think about things you know
- Ask coworkers/friends
- Watch other talks
- Go to meetups
- Look for CFB (Topics) Page for a conference

## Proposals

- About 1/2 of proposals come in low quality

### Outline

- 5-10 Points
- Organize Narrative

### Write a Pitch

- Excite People about the talk
- May go in brochure
- Sell the story
    - Don't talk about yourself or company
- Talk about doing things

### Description

- Use the outline to describe the points
- Add some notes if useful for content

**Prepare to be Rejected!**
(It happens to everyone)

## Getting Accepted

- Confirm you can still come speak
- Build a timeline for preparing the talk
- Keep a working doc to build with

### Writing the Talk

- Titles are good for anchoring the subject area
- Read the code of conduct!
- You should aim for being useful AND interesting, but you can be one or the other
- Bullet Points - A bit boring and uninformational (they should be notes for you, not displayed)
- Books:
    - PresentationZen
    - Slide:ology
    - TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking
    
## Prepare

- Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
- Give the talk to your friends
- Get feedback
- Check Timing

## QnA

- You don't have to take questions (tell mod prior to speaking)
- If people make a statement, thank them and move on
- If you don't know the answer, don't lie, just ask for a post-talk chat or say you need time to think on that.

## How to be an Audience

- Be effusive with praise, quiet with criticism
- Don't ask if they've heard of Y
- Ask about off-topic things post-chat
