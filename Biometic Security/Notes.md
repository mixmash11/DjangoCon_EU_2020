# Biometric Unsecurity

## Types of Security Mech.

### Absolute

- Authentification
    - This exactly matches that
- Authorization
    - This is permitted
    
### Probablistic

- Verification & Identification
    - This seems akin to that
- Categorization
    - Attributes seem to be
    
Biometrics is identification (compares data)

**Unsecurity** - Undoing of safety.
Unravels humanity, rights, etc.

Bodies and therefore biometric things are mutable

Biometrics are educated guesswork

Uniqueness needs to be absolute. *Biometrics are not*

More data in biometrics is not more accuracy. Biometrics bias variables

*Ethical Debt* - Harm imposed on people
"We never thought about the misuse" - common precursor to ethical debt

None of the major training datasets have consensual images
